This is a very common issue about 3 out of 4 hikers will suffer to some extent from the altitude sickness, it is therefore important to familiarize yourself with this condition and preventive measures<br><br>

Cause of altitude sickness “AMS”, as altitude increases the number of oxygen molecules per breath is reduced. At about 12000 feet (3600m) there is about 40% fewer oxygen molecules per breath so the failure of the body to adapt quickly to the reduced oxygen causes altitude sickness<br><br>

The symptoms of altitude sickness “AMS” include in the order normally experienced; headaches, nausea, anorexia, exhaustion, lassitude, rapid pulse, insomnia, swelling of the hands and feet and reduced urine output.<br><br>

What to do if you get altitude sickness “AMS”, the most effective treatment will be by immediately taking the affected person to a lower altitude. Often a drop as little as 500m will be sufficient.<br><br>

<b>Preventive measures to avoid of altitude sickness “AMS”, Climbers can take precautions to at least minimize the severity of the illness</b><br><br>

by maintaining a slow steady pace from day one giving enough time for your body to adapt to the altitude. “pole pole” is a common Swahili phrase translating to slowly, which is now a norm among hikers climbing Mount Kilimanjaro
<br><br> including an extra day of acclimatization at a high altitude
<br>drinking at least 3-4 liters of water every day.
<br> Preventative medicine is also available and you should consult your physician for specialist advice.

        <h5>Mount Oldonyo Lengai</h5>
        <p>
          Mount Oldoinyo Lengai, towering over the East African Rift Valley in Tanzania, is a geological marvel and a sacred landmark for the Maasai people. Its name translates to "Mountain of God" in the Maasai language, hinting at the reverence it commands among the local communities.<br><br>

At 2,878 meters (9,442 feet) above sea level, Oldoinyo Lengai is not the tallest peak in Africa, but it stands out for its unique geological composition and cultural significance. What sets it apart is its rare natrocarbonatite lava, which is the only known active volcano in the world to produce such lava. Natrocarbonatite is rich in sodium and potassium carbonates, giving it a distinctive black color when cooled. This lava has a remarkably low viscosity, allowing it to flow more like water than typical lava, and it solidifies into a distinctively brittle, light-colored material.<br><br>

The mountain's eruptions are not explosive like those of many other volcanoes. Instead, they often feature gentle, effusive flows of the unique natrocarbonatite lava. However, despite its relative quietness, Oldoinyo Lengai poses some hazards due to the extreme heat and the unpredictable nature of volcanic activity.<br><br>

For the Maasai people, Oldoinyo Lengai holds deep spiritual significance. They believe it to be the abode of their god, Engai, and the place where the earth was created. Maasai elders often lead pilgrimages to the mountain, where they perform rituals and prayers, seeking blessings and guidance. The slopes of the mountain are scattered with sacred sites, where offerings are made to appease the gods and seek protection for their communities and livestock.<br><br>

Beyond its cultural and geological significance, Oldoinyo Lengai also attracts adventurers and scientists from around the world. Climbing the mountain presents a unique challenge due to the loose, shifting volcanic ash and the steep gradient of its slopes. However, those who undertake the journey are rewarded with breathtaking views of the surrounding Rift Valley and Lake Natron, a soda lake known for its vibrant pink hue due to algae and minerals.<br><br>

In recent years, efforts have been made to balance the conservation of Oldoinyo Lengai's natural and cultural heritage with tourism and scientific research. Sustainable tourism practices are being promoted to minimize the impact on the fragile ecosystem surrounding the mountain, while ongoing studies help to better understand its volcanic activity and geological features.<br><br>

Mount Oldoinyo Lengai stands as a testament to the intersection of nature, culture, and spirituality—a place where ancient traditions meet the forces of the Earth in a timeless dance.

        <h5>Lake Natron</h5>
        <p>
          Lake Natron, located in northern Tanzania, near the border with Kenya, is a remarkable body of water renowned for its surreal and otherworldly appearance. Its name derives from the naturally occurring sodium carbonate compounds present in its waters, giving it a distinctive red or pink hue, especially noticeable during the dry season.<br><br>

This lake is a salt lake, meaning it has high levels of salt and other minerals. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of cyanobacteria and other microorganisms, which thrive in the highly alkaline environment created by the sodium carbonate. These microorganisms produce pigments that tint the water, resulting in the striking reddish-pink colors that often characterize Lake Natron.<br><br>

Despite its harsh conditions, Lake Natron is home to a surprising array of life, particularly adapted species of flamingos. The lake is one of the most important breeding grounds for lesser flamingos in East Africa. These birds are attracted to the abundance of microscopic algae and invertebrates that thrive in the salty waters. Their pink plumage complements the lake's color, creating a stunning spectacle against the backdrop of the arid landscape.<br><br>
Lake Natron stands as a testament to the resilience of life in even the most extreme environments. Its hauntingly beautiful landscapes and diverse wildlife remind us of the intricate interplay between geology, biology, and culture in shaping the world around us.

        <h5>Traditional Sri lankan Kandy (udarata ) Dancer</h5>
        <p> Kandyan dance encompasses various dance forms popular and native to the area called Kandy of the Central Hills region known as Udarata in Sri Lanka, which have today spread to other parts of the country. It is an example of Sinhalese culture in Sri Lanka. Even though originally only males were allowed to train as dancers, there are now several schools that also train women in the Kandyan dance form. However, there is no definite Ves costume for women, and many female dancers have adapted the male costume in different ways.

          There are only a few performances of the Kohomba Kankariya now due to many social, economic and political reasons. The dance in its traditional form is still performed each year at the Dalada Perhahera in Kandy.</p>

      <h5>Wooden architecture and wood-carving</h5>
      <p>Wooden architecture and wood-carving are inextricably linked in the traditional wooden architecture of Sri Lanka, especially in Kandy, the central province of the country. The allied skills simultaneously highlight the construction and carving skills of master-craftsmen and architects; Kandyan wooden architecture is extremely rich in detailing, show-casing a range of wood-carving, much of which represents a remarkable combination of creativity and skill in manipulating the material.
        The abundance of several varieties of timber was instrumental in the prolific presence of wooden architecture. Owing to its durability and hardness, timber was used to make several structural components like beams and massive pillars, as also elaborately designed doors and windows. The traditional craft of wood-carving was practised by several highly esteemed crfatsmen and master-craftsmen, who trained apprentices in the principles of the craft.</p>
