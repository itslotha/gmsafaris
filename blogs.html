				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">The best time to visit Tanzania depends on your preferences and the specific experiences you're seeking. Generally, Tanzania offers diverse attractions, from wildlife safaris to beach vacations, each influenced by different climatic patterns. Here's a breakdown:<br><br>

					Wildlife Safaris (Northern Circuit - Serengeti, Ngorongoro, Tarangire, and Lake Manyara):
						The dry season (from late June to October) is often considered the best time for wildlife viewing. During this period, vegetation is sparse, making it easier to spot animals congregating around water sources.
						The Great Migration, a spectacular wildlife event, occurs in the Serengeti typically from June to August as millions of wildebeest and other herbivores move in search of greener pastures.
						Shoulder seasons (from January to March and November to mid-December) offer fewer crowds and lush landscapes, although wildlife may be harder to spot due to thicker vegetation.<br><br>
				
					Mount Kilimanjaro Climbing:
						The dry seasons (from late June to October and from December to February) are ideal for climbing Kilimanjaro, as there is less precipitation and clearer skies.
						However, be prepared for colder temperatures at higher altitudes, especially during the nights and early mornings.<br><br>
				
					Zanzibar and Coastal Areas:
						Zanzibar and the Tanzanian coast enjoy warm temperatures year-round, making them ideal destinations for beach vacations.
						The dry season (from June to October) is popular for beach holidays due to minimal rainfall and lower humidity.
						The short rains from November to December are followed by the long rains from March to May, but these periods can still offer enjoyable beach experiences between the showers.<br><br>
				
				Ultimately, the best time to visit Tanzania depends on your priorities. If witnessing the Great Migration is a must, plan your visit during the dry season. For Kilimanjaro climbers, choose the dry months for optimal trekking conditions. If you're more flexible and prefer fewer crowds, consider visiting during the shoulder seasons.</div>

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt"> ENTRY, EXIT, AND VISA REQUIREMENTS.<br>

					Visas are required when traveling to Tanzania. Foreigners may apply for a visa online in advance of travel. Applicants may complete the e-visa application form and make payment online with a credit card or bank transfer at www.immigration.go.tz. If the e-visa is approved, the applicant will receive a “grant notice” via email. Present a copy of the grant notice to the Immigration Officer on arrival at the airport in Tanzania.<br><br>
					
					Also, you can obtain a tourist visa upon your arrival at the airport in Tanzania. The cost is $100 USD for the Americans and 50 $ from other countries. Be prepared to pay in cash in case connectivity issues make electronic transactions impossible.
					
					A passport valid for a minimum of six months beyond visa issuance and/or date of entry, and at least one blank visa page, is required. Visitors who enter on visas must present a roundtrip ticket and demonstrate they have sufficient funds for their stay.
					
					Be prepared to show your passport and explain your visa status when entering or departing Zanzibar or when traveling around the mainland. <br><br>

          The Royal Asiatic Society (CB) was instrumental in bringing to the notice of Gregory on his appointment as Governor in 1872 the need for a public museum with much difficulty the approval of the legislative council was obtained within a year. The Architect of the Public Works Department, J.G. Smither was able to prepare the plans for new structure on Italian architectural style. The construction was completed in 1876 and the Museum commenced it functions in the following year. <br>
          <br>
          The Authorities of the museum took various steps to display the cultural and natural heritage of the country for this purpose.

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">You’ve waited months for your safari to finally come around. And now you have to decide what you must pack for your safari. Decisions, decisions, decisions. SafariBookings is here to help. Below are a few of our tips.<br><br>
					1. Passport, Itinerary, Travel Insurance Docs & Etickets
					It seems obvious, but we would be remiss if we didn't put this at the top of the list of what you must pack for your safari.<br><br>
					2. Prescription Meds
					
					Remember to put your prescription medications in your hand luggage (in case your check-in bag goes astray... it happens!)…and make sure you have enough of each type to last your entire safari.<br><br>
					
					 
					3. Prescription Glasses (Sunglasses, Hat, Sunblock Et Al)
					
					If you wear prescription glasses, be sure to pack more than one set (in case you lose one or they get broken). You will be outdoors for much of the time, so be prepared. Pack a hat, sunblock, long sleeves, and lip balm.<br><br>
					
					 
					4. Camera, Video and Binoculars
					
					Whilst most people will remember to take their camera and/or video (or will use their mobile phone), not everyone thinks they need to take binoculars! Binoculars are ESSENTIAL for optimum wildlife viewing on safari (and a GOOD pair of binoculars will make a BIG difference to your safari). We strongly recommend a pair of binoculars on safari. Get the most expensive you can afford (at least 8x or better still 10x magnification).
					
					Africa is a photographer’s dream. Not only does the boundless wildlife come in all shapes and sizes, but the continent is also blessed with stunning landscapes, colorful people and fabulous light! Don’t miss out. Buy a camera, if you don’t already have one.
					Of course you’re not going to forget clothes! But are you taking the right clothes…and are you within those weight restrictions your travel agent told you about for those light aircraft flights? Most international airlines will restrict your check-in luggage to around 20 to 30kgs (55lbs). However, if your safari itinerary includes any light aircraft flights, then this can mean as little as 12 to 15 kgs (sometimes including your hand luggage!).<br><br>
					Layering Is Key
					
					Wearing clothes in layers is the most practical way to cope with fluctuating day/night temperatures and cool evenings whilst on safari. As the day warms up you can peel off another layer. Then as it begins to cool toward evening, you can put them back on.</div>

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">Golden Memories Safaries have sent a countless number of LGBT couples to safari in Tanzania. However, it is good to familiarize yourself with Tanzania’s local laws and customs just like when planning any other international trip.<br>As a country, Tanzania does not have a progressive attitude regarding same-sex relationships, however, these regulations do not in anyhow affect tourists, you will not encounter any problem in Tanzania as an LGBTQ traveler. However, we recommend you limit PDAS to your time & area of privacy <br><br>

          <br>LGBT COMMUNITY IN AFRICA.<br>

		  Same-sex relationships are not legal in most of the African states. In many countries same-sex is illegal, but the laws are not strictly implemented. So, be aware that even if same-sex relationships are legal in a certain destination the local society can be intolerant.
		  
		  Although anti-LGBT behavior is not likely to be directed at tourists, we provide a few information for LGBT travelers to Tanzania as follows.<br><br>
		  
			  No PDAs (public displays of affection).<br>
		  
		  Avoid open displays of affection outside of hotels or lodges. Visitors to Tanzania are typically not disturbed, for example, none of our LGBT clients has encountered issues related to Homophobia. However, it is important to understand that same-sex relationships might not be appreciated by the locals when displayed openly.
		  
		  Note: Public displays of affections even between people of different sexes are not quite common to our Tanzanian culture. As a fact, the majority of millennials are yet to witness their parents kissing. <br>
          
          <br>As a tourist, there’s no need to be overly worried, as visitors rarely encounter issues. However, as always, discretion is advised, and in certain lodgings and situations, we might even recommend twin-bed rooms as a precaution.</div>

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">Tipping is always a popular subject with Tanzania safaris, Kilimanjaro hiking & the overall Tanzania Holiday. Travelers often ask themselves how much should I tip? or why should I tip? After paying for your safari it is only logical asking yourself these questions given the sums already paid for the safari.
					Tipping culture & origin in Tanzania<br><br>
					
					Tanzania is not a wealthy country, and Westerners might see the local customary wages as unjust. So it has always been a tradition to tip your safari crew or mountain crew and others who serve you while traveling in Tanzania. In fact, it is fair to say tips are expected when traveling through Tanzania and the crew or servers will feel unappreciated when not tipped.<br><br>
					How to make sure your tip gets where you intend it to?<br>
					
					You should make an effort to hand your tip directly to the person it is for. In this way, you can help ensure that your wishes are being respected. It is fine if you wish to put your tip into an envelope or give a group tip to be divided evenly but you should make effort to let the crew informed so each can receive as you planned
					When to tip.<br>
					
					Most clients tip at the end of the safari, which makes sense as it should be based upon the overall satisfaction of your crew<br><br>
					
					Note: Why don’t safari soles add a surcharge to the trip’s price to cover tips?<br>
					
						Tipping in Tanzania is tax free, we adding it onto the price will be subjected to 18% vat on the price & as the tips will then be tamed as official income to the crew it will then be subjected to income tax. Hence lowering the value, the crew receives or increase the tip amount to the client
						Transparency, we do believe our team have full trust on us but to ensure we don’t ever have to explain we encourage our clients to tip directly and recommend those whom feel need to discreet should use envelopes.<br>
					
					<br><b>Who to tip?</b><br>
					
						Guides<br>
						Cook<br>
						Servers<br><br>
					
					We recommend that travelers tip between the below guideline, However tipping is not mandatory or enforced but highly recommended. As it is a safari tradition & the crew will be expecting some tips. you can tip more or less depending on the performance of the crew<br><br>
					
						US$ 8 -10 per guest per day for a group guide
						US$ 20 – 30 per guest per day for a private guide
						US$ 8 -10 per guest per day for a group safari chef
						US$ 15 – 25 per guest per day for a private safari chef
						US$ 1-5 for general staff</div>
